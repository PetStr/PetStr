## I'm PetStr 

My usage experience regarding software

* Editors, Emacs looking into Visual Studio Code.
* Build systems, I prefer Makefile. looking into cmake. Seems too much boilerplate to make it work. 
* Language, C++, is there anything else?
* Compilers, anything out there. gcc, clang.
* GUI - GTKMM. enuff said.
* Software platform, anything out there. Linux-intel, Linux-arm, Win10-intel.
* Hardware platforms, x86_32, x86_64, ARM-v7, ARM-M1.

Types of software.
* Scientific calculations. Calculation of gas data thermodynamic stuff. Gas equilibrium, adiabatic flame temperature, general gas data.  
* Real time control, Combustion engine lab control.
* Data aquisition. AD sampling.
* Database query, pull data from SQL database to then process and put into spreadsheet. Hundreds of tables.
* Controlling and monotoring sensors and actuators through Controller Area Network. Kvaser and socketcan.
* Playing with ISO 14229 and ISO-TP CAN. 
* Processing logdata. blf and customs formats. 

I have never really worked with embedded stuff. Mostly it has been PC based. 

Coding style. I prefer to start with a concrete example. Then after the problem evolved gratually go for appropriate abstractions.
