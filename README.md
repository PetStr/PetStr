## I'm PetStr 

This is a brief abstract of my experience regarding writing advanced and compiled software.

I do have experience with working with Matlab, Octave, Simulink, to some extent Python and some other obscure languages. 

Generally I prefer to write for a multitude of platforms. I usually change ruthlessly between Linux, Windows and MacOS operating systems. Most projects have been written on any one if them. At least a subset of the applications I write can be run and tested on any of them. I want to know how things works so I would like to stay close to the metal so to say. I feel that if I am close, if something stops working it is easier to figure out what went wrong. Hiding behind a fancy IDE does not help there. 

* Editors, right now mainly using Visual Studio Code, I used Emacs and vim in the past.
* Build systems, I prefer Makefile. looking into cmake.  
* Language, C++, is there anything else?
* Compilers, anything out there. gcc, clang. compliant and multiplatform.
* GUI - GTKMM. enuff said.
* Software platform, anything out there. Linux-intel, Linux-arm, Win10-intel.
* Hardware platforms, x86_32, x86_64, ARM-v7, ARM-M1.

Example of the types of software I have written:
* Scientific calculations. Calculation of gas data thermodynamic stuff. Gas equilibrium, adiabatic flame temperature, general gas data. A sample of this code is just about to be released. 
* Real time control (well sort if, soft real time control). Combustion engine lab control. During my postgraduate studies I wrote an engine control / rig control program that was used for experiments on a combustion engine. In short we used cylinder pressure signal to control combustion. Using Simulink Controller in the loop. Together with expert from automatic control department several advanved control topologies were tested. PID, LQG, MPC[pdh thesis].
* Data aquisition. AD sampling.
* Database query, pull data from SQL database to then process and put into spreadsheet.
* Controlling and monotoring sensors and actuators through Controller Area Network. Kvaser and socketcan.
* Playing with ISO 14229 and ISO-TP CAN. 
* Processing logdata. blf and customs formats. 

I have never really worked with embedded stuff. Mostly it has been PC based. 

Coding style. I prefer to start with a concrete example. Start to get something working and then evolved gratually go for appropriate abstractions.
