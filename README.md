## I'm PetStr 
I'm interested in software. 

* Editors, Emacs looking into Visual Studio Code.
* Build systems, I prefer Makefile. looking into cmake. Seems too much boilerplate to make it work. 
* Language, C++, is there anything else?
* Compilers, anything out there. gcc, clang.
* GUI - GTKMM. enuff said.
* Software platform, anything out there. Linux-intel, Linux-arm, Win10-intel.
* Hardware platforms, x86_32, x86_64, ARM-v7, ARM-M1.

Types of software.
* Scientific calculations. Calculation of gas data thermodynamic stuff.
* Real time control, Combustion engine lab control.
* Database query, pull data from SQL process and put into spreadsheet. Hundreds of tables.
* Controlling sensors and actuators through Controller Area Network. Kvaser and socketcan.
* Processing logdata. blf and customs formats. 

I have never really worked with embedded stuff. Mostly it has been PC based.
